# Assignment

We have a list of people with birth year and death year. How can we figure out what year(s) has the highest population?

```js
console.log(getYearsWithHighestPopulation([[1920, 1939], [1911, 1944], [1920, 1955], [1938, 1939]]))
> [1938, 1939]
```

# Running it

```bash
yarn install
node -r @babel/register index.js
```
